  	<p><a href="http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/"><img class="image" src="img/blueprint.png"/></a>BLUEPRINT is a high impact FP7 project aiming to produce a blueprint of haemopoetic epigenomes. Our goal is to apply highly sophisticated functional genomics analysis on a clearly defined set of primarily human samples from healthy and diseased individuals, and to provide at least 100 reference epigenomes to the scientific community. This resource-generating activity will be complemented by research into blood-based diseases, including common leukaemias and autoimmune disease (Type 1 Diabetes), by discovery and validation of epigenetic markers for diagnostic use and by epigenetic target identification.This may eventually lead to the development of novel and more individualised medical treatments. This website will provide links to the data &amp; primary analysis generated by the project.</p>
