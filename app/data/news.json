    "content":  "The eighth Blueprint data release is now available. We have isolated cells from 181 bone marrow, 625 venous blood, 135 cord blood, 4 liver, 35 tonsil, 12 lymph node, 20 thymus and 7 cell lines. The epigenomic analysis performed includes RNA-seq, DNAme-seq, DNAseI-seq and 8 different ChIP-seq experiments. A total of 112 complete and 485 partial epigenomes have been released via EGA datasets, the FTP site and trackhubs."

    "content": "The seventh Blueprint data release is now available. Within Blueprint we have so far isolated cells from 79 Bone marrow, 217 Venous blood, 111 Cord blood, 10 Tonsil, 8 Thymus and 7 Cell line samples and performed epigenomic analysis including RNA-seq, DNAme-seq, DNAseI-seq and 8 different ChIP-seq experiments. All the sequence data from Blueprint were remapped to new human genome assembly GRCh38 for this release. This includes data from monocytes, granulocyte neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages ( M0 , M1 and M2 ), naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ cells and cell line samples. Future releases of data for additional samples are planned at a regular basis."
