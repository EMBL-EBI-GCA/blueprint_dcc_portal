NextFlex adapters (BiooScientific, TX, USA) were ligated to the cDNA at room temperature for 15 minutes with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Adapter-ligated cDNA was purified using the Minelute Reaction Cleanup Kit(Qiagen). Size selection was performed using the 2% E-Gel SizeSelect Agarose Gels and a 100 bp DNA marker according to manufacturers recommendations.
