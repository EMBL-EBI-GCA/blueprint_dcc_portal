The cDNA was purified using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen)according to manufacturers recommendations. PE adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the cDNA at room temperature for 15 minutes with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Adapter-ligated cDNA was purified using the Minelute Reaction Cleanup Kit(Qiagen). Size selection was performed using the 2% E-Gel SizeSelect Agarose Gels and a 100 bp DNA marker according to manufacturers recommendations.  Adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by PCR with reaction composition: 36 µl DNA, 10 µl 5x HF Phusion buffer 1.5 µl dNTP mix (10mM each) 1 µl PE PCR primer 1.0, 1 µl PE PCR primer 2.0, 0.5 µl Phusion polymerase (1 U)"
