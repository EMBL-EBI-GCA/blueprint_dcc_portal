The cDNA was purified using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen)according to manufacturers recommendations. Nexflex adapter (BiooScientific, TX, USA) was ligated to the cDNA at room temperature for 15 minutes with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Adapter-ligated cDNA was purified using the Minelute Reaction Cleanup Kit(Qiagen). Size selection was performed using the 2% E-Gel SizeSelect Agarose Gels and a 100 bp DNA marker according to manufacturers recommendations.  Adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by PCR with reaction composition: 23 µl DNA,  2 µl PE PCR primer mix 25 ml Kapa HiFi polymerase (Ready Mix)"
