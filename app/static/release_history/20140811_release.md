***
##08 August 2014

The fifth Blueprint data release is now available. Within BLUEPRINT we isolated cells from 4 Bone marrow, 18 Venous blood, 25 Cord blood, 1 Tonsil and 7 Cell line samples and performed epigenomic analysis including RNA-seq, DNAme-seq, DNAseI-seq and 8 different ChIP-seq experiments. This release includes  data from monocytes, granulocyte neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages ( M0 , M1 and M2 ), naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ cells apart from 7 cell line samples. Future releases of data for additional samples are planned at a regular basis. This release included 16 complete reference epigenomes. There were also 18 samples with partial reference epigenomes.
