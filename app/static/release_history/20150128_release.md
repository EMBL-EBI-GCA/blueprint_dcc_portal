##Release description 

The sixth Blueprint data release is now available. Within Blueprint we have so far isolated cells from 11 Bone marrow, 64 Venous blood, 46 Cord blood, 1 Tonsil and 7 Cell line samples and performed epigenomic analysis including RNA-seq, DNAme-seq, DNAseI-seq and 8 different ChIP-seq experiments. This release includes data from monocytes, granulocyte neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages ( M0 , M1 and M2 ), naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ cells and cell line samples. This release included 23 complete reference epigenomes. There were also 56 samples with partial reference epigenomes.
