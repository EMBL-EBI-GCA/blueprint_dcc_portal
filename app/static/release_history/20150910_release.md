#Data release - September 2015
***
##10 September 2015

The seventh Blueprint data release is now available. Within Blueprint we have so far isolated cells from 79 Bone marrow, 217 Venous blood, 111 Cord blood, 10 Tonsil, 8 Thymus and 7 Cell line samples and performed epigenomic analysis including RNA-seq, DNAme-seq, DNAseI-seq and 8 different ChIP-seq experiments. All the sequence data from Blueprint were remapped to new human genome assembly GRCh38 for this release. This includes data from monocytes, granulocyte neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages ( M0 , M1 and M2 ), naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ cells and cell line samples. This release included 4 complete reference epigenomes. There were also 290 samples with incomplete reference epigenomes.
