The Blueprint consortium anticipates that others will use the data generated by the project. Access to sequencing reads and alignments is available by application to the Blueprint Data Access Committee. Access will be granted to investigators for appropriate use, subject to the criteria laid out in data access committee's general principles ([DOC](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/data_access/Blueprint_DAC_general_principles.doc "DAC Principles - DOC"), [PDF](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/data_access/Blueprint_DAC_general_principles.pdf "DAC Principles - PDF")).

Reuse of any Blueprint data, be it available publicly or through the EGA, is subject to the BLUEPRINT data [reuse policy](#/md/data_reuse).
