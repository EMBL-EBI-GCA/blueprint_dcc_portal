##Data mining 

CNIO & BSC provide a [BioMart hosting Blueprint data](http://blueprint.bsc.es/). Further information can be found in the [tutorial](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/UserFiles/file/Protocols/biomart_tutorial.pdf).  

##Genome browsers

Genomatix provide a [visual interface](http://blueprint.genomatix.de/) for exploring & analysing Blueprint data. They have also produced a [webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6SAjCUR1eo&feature=youtu.be), explaining the features of the software. 

Blueprint data can be viewed in the UCSC and ensembl browsers through a [track hub](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html). We have produced a [tutorial](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/trackhub_tutorial.pdf) describing how to use this. Alternatively you can use these links to add the current track hub to a genome browser:

##IHEC Data

Data from Blueprint is included in the [IHEC data grid](http://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/).
