##Data
***

Data generated by the Blueprint project is available from multiple sources.

Raw data, such as sequencing reads and array data are available from the archives. The majority of data is archived with the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega"><abbr title="European Genome-phenome Archive">EGA</abbr></a> as it requires managed access. The remainder is archived with the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena"><abbr title="European Nucleotide Archive">ENA</abbr></a>. Links to the data can be found through the [experiment grid](#/experiments). 

Analysis results that pose a risk of reidentification will be archived in the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega"><abbr title="European Genome-phenome Archive">EGA</abbr></a> and made available through managed access. At present, this is limited to alignments (BAM files). This will also apply to variant calls (VCF files) when they are included in a release. The generally accessible data resources for the project do not include this class of data.

The project FTP site provides documentation 


##Data release
***

Alignments (BAM files) and variant calls will be archived with the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega"><abbr title="European Genome-phenome Archive">EGA</abbr></a> at each data release and included in the release datasets. 

The [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/) provides files and documentation

All users of data & analysis generated by Blueprint must abide by the [data reuse policy](#/md/data_reuse).
