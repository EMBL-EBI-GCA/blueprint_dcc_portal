#Help

The DCC portal exists to help users discover the raw and processed data Blueprint has produced while investigating the epigenomics of haematopoesis.

The following paragraphs describe the different tabs which you can see in the banner menu at the top of this site.

##Experiments

On the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), we present a table where each row refers to a particular biological sample. Each column corresponds to a specific assay type and the blue dots indicates which assay is conducted on which samples.  Each blue dot links to page that describes a particular [experiment](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments/ERX547946). This page also contains faceted menus on the left hand side that allow you to restrict the table to a particular class of assay, cell type or disease state. This [walkthrough](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/dcc_help_pages/Experiments_walkthrough.pdf) explains the page in more detail.

##Files

Each [individual experiment page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments/ERX547946) lists all the files available for that particular sample and experiment. The [Files page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/files) provides a complete list of all the files we have available for download. Like the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), the page displays a table. Each row in this table represents one file. We present faceted menus on the lefthand side allowing you to filter the table to particular subsets of data. You can download the whole table in [tab delimited format](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/data/blueprint_files.tsv) A walkthrough for this page can be found [here](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/dcc_help_pages/Files_walkthrough.pdf).

##Datasets

The [Datasets page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) lists the EGA Datasets produced by Blueprint. The left hand side faceted menus can be used to restrict the table to datasets for any specific data release or particular data type and sample type. Instructions on how to apply to Blueprint for access can be found on the [DAC applications page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/dac_applications). This [walkthrough](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/dcc_help_pages/Datasets_walkthrough.pdf) describes this [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) in further detail. 

##Data Access

The [Data access page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/data) describes the the different ways you can access Blueprint data and file formats we present our data in.

##Methods

The [Methods page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/methods) lists the analysis protocols for our different analysis types.

##Release history

The [Release history](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/release_history) page provides a list of all Blueprint public data releases and links to summaries for each release.
