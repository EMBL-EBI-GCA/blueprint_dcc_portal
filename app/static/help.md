##How to find information about experiments

Go to the [Experiments page](#/experiments). Each row refers to one sample. Click on the items on the left hand side of the page to filter which samples are shown, or use the text search in the top right corner. A blue dot indicates that data has been released for a sample. Clicking on the dots will bring you to a page listing the files available for the experiment, and showing metadata for the sample and experiment. This page also includes a link to the archived raw data. Most data is archived at the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega"><abbr title="European Genome-phenome Archive">EGA</abbr></a> and access will require an [application](#/md/dac_applications) to the [DAC](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/dacs/EGAC00001000135).

##How to find data

You can follow the directions listed above, to find data per experiment. Alternatively, go to the [Files page](#/files). Each row is one file. As with the [Experiments page](#/experiments) page, click on the items on the left hand side of the page to filter which files are shown, or use the text search in the top right corner. Links are provided to download the file, see the metadata or access the analysis methods used to generate the file. A link to download the file information as a spreadsheet (tab-separated text file) is included on this page.

###Data mining 

CNIO & BSC provide a [BioMart hosting BLUEPRINT data](http://blueprint.bsc.es/). Further information can be found in the [tutorial](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/UserFiles/file/Protocols/biomart_tutorial.pdf).  

###Genome browsers

Genomatix provide a [visual interface](http://blueprint.genomatix.de/) for exploring & analysing BLUEPRINT data. They have also produced a [webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6SAjCUR1eo&feature=youtu.be), explaining the features of the software. 

BLUEPRINT data can be viewed in the UCSC and ensembl browsers through a [track hub](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html). We have produced a [tutorial](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/blueprint/trackhub_tutorial.pdf) describing how to use this. Alternatively you can use these links to add the current track hub to a genome browser:

###IHEC Data

Data from BLUEPRINT is included in the [IHEC data grid](http://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/).
