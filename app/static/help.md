#Help

The DCC portal is setup to help users discover the raw and processed data Blueprint has produced while investigating the epigenomics of haematopoesis

The following paragraphs describe the different tabs which you can see in the banner menu of this site.

##Experiments

On the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), each row refers to a particular biological sample and the columns link to information about a particular assay conducted in that sample. This [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments) also contains facet menus down the left hand side which allow you to restrict the table to a particular class of assay, cell type or disease state. This [walkthrough]() explains the page in more details

##Files

You can follow the directions listed above, to find data per experiment. Alternatively, go to the [Files page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/files). Each row represents one file.  Similar to the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), this [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/files) can also be searched for any specific files using the search box and left hand side facet menus. A walkthrough for [Files page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/files) can be found [here]().

##Datasets

The [Datasets page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) lists the EGA Datasets produced by BLUEPRINT. The left hand side facet menus can be used to limit datasets from any specific data release, data types and sample types. Blueprint dataset access process and forms for this can be found on the [DAC applications page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/dac_applications). This [walkthrough]() describes this [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) in further details. 

##Data Access

The [Data access page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/data) describes the availability of BLUEPRINT data and file format details.
