#Help

The DCC portal exists to help users discover the raw and processed data Blueprint has produced while investigating the epigenomics of haematopoesis.

The following paragraphs describe the different tabs which you can see in the banner menu at the top of this site.

##Experiments

On the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), each row refers to a particular biological sample and the columns link to [pages](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments/ERX547946) that describe a particular assay conducted in that sample. This page also contains faceted menus down the left hand side that allow you to restrict the table to a particular class of assay, cell type or disease state. This [walkthrough]() explains the page in more details.

##Files

Each [individual experiment page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments/ERX547946) lists all the files available for download associated with that particular sample and experiment. The [Files page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/files) provides a complete list of all the files we have available for download. Like the [Experiments page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/experiments), the page displays a table. Each row in this table represents one file. We also present faceted menus on the lefthand side allowing you to filter the table to particular subsets of data. You can also download the whole table is [tab delimited format](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/data/blueprint_files.tsv) A walkthrough for this page can be found [here]().

##Datasets

The [Datasets page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) lists the EGA Datasets produced by Blueprint. The left hand side facet menus can be used to limit datasets for any specific data release or particular data types and sample types. Instructions on how to apply to Blueprint for access can be found on the [DAC applications page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/dac_applications). This [walkthrough]() describes this [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/datasets) in further details. 

##Data Access

The [Data access page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/data) describes the the different ways you can access Blueprint data and file formats we present our data in.

##Methods

This [page](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/methods) lists the analysis protocols for our different analysis types.
